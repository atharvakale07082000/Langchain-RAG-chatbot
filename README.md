This project is a sophisticated chatbot built using the LangChain library. It is designed to handle multi-document support, manage large datasets efficiently, and provide advanced query capabilities with contextual understanding. The chatbot interacts via a FastAPI interface and is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. MongoDB is used to store chat memory, sessions, file data, and vector stores, ensuring no local data storage.

Features
1. Multi-Document Support
File Formats: The chatbot can process and integrate data from multiple documents in various formats, such as PDF, Word, and TXT files.
Data Integration: It consolidates information from different documents to provide comprehensive responses.

2. Large Data Handling
Efficiency: Designed to manage and query large volumes of data efficiently.
Scalability: Optimized for handling data-intensive applications with minimal latency.

3. Advanced Query Capabilities
Vector Stores: Utilizes vector stores to perform similarity searches, enabling the chatbot to answer complex queries based on the ingested data.
Intelligent Querying: Leverages LangChain's advanced querying capabilities to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.

4. Contextual Understanding
Chat Memory: Maintains context across interactions by saving chat memory.
Enhanced Interactions: This feature enhances the chatbot's ability to provide more personalized and coherent responses over time.

5. API Development
FastAPI Interface: The chatbot is accessible via a FastAPI interface, providing a user-friendly and efficient interaction point.
Endpoints: Well-documented endpoints for easy integration with other systems or applications.

6. Object-Oriented Programming
Code Structure: The project is organized using OOP principles, ensuring clear organization, modularity, and reusability of the code.
Scalability: The OOP approach allows for easy expansion and maintenance of the codebase.

7. Exception Handling
Robust Error Management: Comprehensive exception handling is implemented to manage errors gracefully.
Stability: Ensures the chatbot remains functional and reliable, even in the face of unexpected inputs or issues.

8. Database Integration
MongoDB: All data, including chat memory, chat sessions, file data, and vector stores, is stored in MongoDB.
No Local Storage: Ensures that all data is securely stored in the cloud with no local dependencies.
